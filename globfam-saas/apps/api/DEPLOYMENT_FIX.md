# API Deployment Fix Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Railway Deployment

### 1. Updated Server Binding (apps/api/src/index.ts)
- Changed from `app.listen(PORT)` to `app.listen(Number(PORT), '0.0.0.0')`
- This ensures the server binds to all interfaces, which is required for Railway

### 2. Enhanced Startup Script (apps/api/start-production.sh)
- Added comprehensive environment variable checks
- Added Node.js and npm version logging
- Added file existence checks for dist/index.js
- Added timeout for database migrations (30 seconds)
- Better error messages and debugging output

### 3. Fixed Nixpacks Configuration (apps/api/nixpacks.toml)
- Changed nodejs package from "nodejs-18_x" to "nodejs_18"
- Added postgresql client for Prisma

### 4. Created Debug Scripts
- simple-start.js: Minimal HTTP server for testing
- start-production-debug.sh: Debug script to check file structure

## Next Steps if Deployment Still Fails

1. **Check Deploy Logs in Railway**
   - Look for the startup messages from our enhanced script
   - Check if environment variables are being detected
   - Look for any error messages after "Starting Node.js server..."

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required variables are set in Railway:
     - DATABASE_URL
     - JWT_SECRET
     - REDIS_URL
     - PORT (should be auto-set by Railway)

3. **If Server Starts but Health Checks Fail**
   - The server might be crashing after startup
   - Check for missing dependencies or runtime errors
   - Try using the debug start command temporarily

4. **Alternative Start Commands to Try**
   If the current setup fails, try these in Railway settings:
   ```
   # Option 1: Skip migrations
   node dist/index.js
   
   # Option 2: Use debug script
   sh start-production-debug.sh
   
   # Option 3: Simple health check only
   node simple-start.js
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Cannot find module" errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are in package.json (not devDependencies)
   - Check that npm install completes successfully

2. **Database connection failures**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL includes ?sslmode=require for Railway PostgreSQL
   - Check if database is accessible from Railway network

3. **Port binding issues**
   - Railway provides PORT environment variable
   - Server must bind to 0.0.0.0:$PORT (not localhost)

4. **Memory issues**
   - NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=512 should be set in Railway

## Validation Before Next Deploy

Run these checks locally:
```bash
cd apps/api
npm run build
node dist/index.js
# Visit http://localhost:3001/health
```

If the health check works locally, the deployment should work on Railway with the proper environment variables.
