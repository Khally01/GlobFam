# How to Find Railway Shell Access

## Current Railway UI (2024)

### Method 1: Direct Shell Access
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click on your "GlobFam" project
3. Click on your API service (the one that's running, not the database)
4. Look for these options:
   - **Top right corner**: Look for a terminal icon (>_) or "Shell" button
   - **Service menu**: Three dots (...) menu might have "Open Shell"
   - **Deployments tab**: Sometimes the shell option is in the deployments section

### Method 2: Through Deployments
1. In your API service, go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click on the active deployment (green dot)
3. Look for "View Logs" or "Shell" option
4. There might be a terminal icon next to the logs

### Method 3: Command Palette
1. Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) anywhere in Railway
2. Type "shell" or "terminal"
3. Select "Open Shell" for your service

## If Shell is Not Available

Railway doesn't always enable shell access by default. If you can't find it:

### Enable Railway Shell:
1. Go to your API service
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Service" section
4. Look for:
   - "Enable Runtime Logs"
   - "Enable Shell"
   - "Command" settings
5. Make sure these are enabled

### Alternative: Use Railway CLI
Since you have Railway CLI installed, try:

```bash
# This might open an interactive shell
railway shell
```

Or:

```bash
# Run commands directly
railway exec npx prisma migrate resolve --applied "20250617223112_init"
```

## If Nothing Works - Quick Fix Solution

Let me create a temporary API endpoint to fix the migrations:

1. Create a temporary fix endpoint in your API
2. Deploy it
3. Hit the endpoint once
4. Remove the endpoint

## Visual Guide

The shell typically appears in one of these locations:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ GlobFam > API Service               │
│                                [>_] │ <- Terminal icon here
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Deployments | Settings | Logs | ... │
│                                     │
│ [Active Deployment]                 │
│   └── View Logs | Shell | Restart  │ <- Or here
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
