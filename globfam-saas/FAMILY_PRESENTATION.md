# GlobFam - Family Presentation Guide

## üéØ Quick Pitch (30 seconds)

**English:**
"I'm building GlobFam - a family finance app for international students like us. It tracks our money in both Mongolia and Australia, helps with visa compliance, and lets our family share financial information securely. Think of it as having our family's wealth dashboard across borders."

## üè¢ Business Case

### The Problem We Solve:
1. **Multi-country asset tracking**: Students have money in home + host countries
2. **Family communication**: Parents want to help but don't know financial status
3. **Visa compliance**: Work hour limits, financial requirements are complex
4. **Currency confusion**: Real-time AUD/MNT/USD conversion needed

### Market Size:
- **700,000+** international students in Australia
- **50,000+** Mongolian diaspora globally
- **$45 billion** international student market
- **Growing** 15% annually

### Revenue Model:
- $9.99/month (Starter) ‚Üí $120/year
- $19.99/month (Family) ‚Üí $240/year  
- $39.99/month (Premium) ‚Üí $480/year

**If just 1,000 Mongolian families subscribe ‚Üí $240,000/year revenue**

## üí° Family Questions & Answers

### Q: "Who would pay for this?"
**A:** International student families. Parents in Mongolia pay $20-40/month to help their children manage finances properly. It's cheaper than one consulting call.

### Q: "How is this different from existing apps?"
**A:** Existing apps (YNAB, Mint) don't understand:
- Multi-country assets
- Visa work hour limits  
- Family sharing across borders
- Real-time currency conversion
- International student specific needs

### Q: "What if competitors copy you?"
**A:** We have first-mover advantage with Mongolian community. Strong network effects - families invite families. Deep understanding of international student journey.

### Q: "How much money do you need?"
**A:** 
- **Bootstrap phase**: $0 (already built MVP)
- **Growth phase**: $50K for marketing, team expansion
- **Scale phase**: $500K for international expansion

### Q: "What's the timeline?"
**A:**
- **Month 1-3**: Launch beta with 100 Mongolian families
- **Month 4-6**: Public launch, 1,000 users
- **Month 7-12**: Expand to other Asian communities
- **Year 2**: International expansion
