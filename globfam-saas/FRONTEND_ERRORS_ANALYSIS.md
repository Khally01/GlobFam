# Frontend Errors Analysis & Solutions

## Critical Issues Found:

### 1. CORS Policy Errors (Main Issue)
All API requests from `https://globfam-front-end-v1.up.railway.app` to `https://globfam-v1.up.railway.app` are being blocked by CORS.

**Error**: "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://globfam-v1.up.railway.app/api/*' from origin 'https://globfam-front-end-v1.up.railway.app' has been blocked by CORS policy"

### 2. Authentication Issues
- User data exists but verifying token fails
- Analytics API errors (404)
- Transactions, assets, families, goals all failing to load

### 3. Missing Frontend URL in CORS

## Immediate Fix Required:

### Step 1: Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS in Railway API

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click on your API service (globfam-v1)
3. Go to Variables tab
4. Find `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
5. Update it to include your frontend URL:

```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://globfam-front-end-v1.up.railway.app,https://globfam-v1.up.railway.app,http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2: Update API_URL in Frontend (if needed)

1. Go to your Frontend service in Railway
2. Check Variables tab
3. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set to:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://globfam-v1.up.railway.app
```

## What's Currently Working:
- Frontend is deployed and loading
- User authentication data is stored (you're logged in)
- UI is rendering correctly

## What's Not Working:
- All API calls are blocked by CORS
- Cannot fetch assets, transactions, families
- Cannot create new assets
- Analytics endpoints return 404

## Quick Test After Fix:

After updating ALLOWED_ORIGINS, the page should automatically start working. You can test by:
1. Refreshing the page
2. Trying to add a new asset
3. Checking if data loads

## Additional Fixes Needed:

### Fix Analytics Route (404 Error)
The analytics route seems to be missing. Check if the route exists in the API.

### Environment Variables to Verify:

**API Service (globfam-v1):**
- ALLOWED_ORIGINS (must include frontend URL)
- DATABASE_URL ✓
- REDIS_URL ✓
- JWT_SECRET ✓
- JWT_REFRESH_SECRET ✓
- ENCRYPTION_KEY ✓

**Frontend Service (globfam-front-end-v1):**
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://globfam-v1.up.railway.app
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=GlobFam

## Summary:

The main issue is CORS blocking all API requests. Once you add the frontend URL to ALLOWED_ORIGINS, everything should start working!
