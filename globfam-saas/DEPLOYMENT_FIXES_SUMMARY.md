# Railway Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ TypeScript Build Errors in API
**Problem**: AuthRequest interface conflicts with Express type augmentation
**Solution**: 
- Changed `export interface AuthRequest extends Request` to `export type AuthRequest = Request`
- Removed duplicate type definitions
- Fixed in: `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts`

### 2. ✅ Nullable Description in AI Service
**Problem**: TransactionForCategorization interface didn't accept null descriptions
**Solution**:
- Updated interface to accept `description: string | null`
- Added null handling in buildCategorizationPrompt method
- Fixed in: `apps/api/src/services/ai/openai.service.ts`

### 3. ✅ Missing Railway Configuration
**Problem**: Empty railway.toml file
**Solution**:
- Restored railway.toml with proper Nixpacks configuration
- Added .railwayignore files for both services

### 4. ✅ Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: json2csv and exceljs not in package.json
**Solution**:
- Added both dependencies to API package.json

## Deployment Configuration Files

### API Service (`apps/api/`)
- `railway.toml` - Main Railway configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration with Node.js 18
- `.railwayignore` - Ignore unnecessary files

### Web Service (`apps/web/`)
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration for Next.js
- `railway-build.sh` - Custom build script for monorepo
- `.railwayignore` - Ignore unnecessary files

## Required Environment Variables

### API Service
```bash
DATABASE_URL=            # From Railway PostgreSQL
REDIS_URL=               # From Railway Redis  
JWT_SECRET=              # 32-char secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=      # 32-char secret
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=         # Frontend URL
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Web Service
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=     # API service URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=GlobFam
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=     # Frontend URL
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Set up Railway services**:
   - Create PostgreSQL database
   - Create Redis instance
   - Note the connection URLs

2. **Deploy API first**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   railway link
   railway up
   ```

3. **Deploy Web app**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   railway link
   railway up
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check API health: `https://api-url/health`
   - Check database: `https://api-url/api/db-health`
   - Visit web app and test login

## Common Issues

1. **Build fails with memory error**:
   - Increase service memory in Railway dashboard
   - Consider using `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096`

2. **Database migration fails**:
   - Ensure DATABASE_URL is set correctly
   - Check if database is accessible
   - Run migrations manually if needed

3. **CORS errors**:
   - Verify ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes full frontend URL
   - Include protocol (https://)

4. **Module not found errors**:
   - Web app uses custom build script
   - Ensure railway-build.sh is executable
   - Check monorepo package references

## Scripts Created

- `deploy-to-railway.sh` - Automated deployment script
- `test-build.sh` - Local build testing
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Full deployment guide

## Next Steps

1. Run local build test to ensure no TypeScript errors
2. Set up environment variables in Railway
3. Deploy API service first
4. Deploy Web service after API is running
5. Monitor logs for any issues

The main blocking issues have been resolved. The services should now deploy successfully on Railway.
