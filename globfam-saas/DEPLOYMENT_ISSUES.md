# GlobFam Deployment Issues & Solutions

## Current Status
âœ… **API is running successfully** but with some issues to address

## Issues Found

### 1. Database Migration Error (CRITICAL)
**Error**: `P3005 - The database schema is not empty`

**Cause**: The Railway PostgreSQL database already has tables/schema that weren't created by Prisma migrations.

**Solution**:
1. Run the baseline script in Railway console:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   ./scripts/baseline-database.sh
   ```
   
   OR manually run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate resolve --applied "20250617223112_init"
   npx prisma migrate resolve --applied "20250625000000_add_budget_models"
   ```

2. For a clean start (if no important data):
   ```bash
   # WARNING: This will delete all data!
   npx prisma migrate reset --force
   ```

### 2. NPM Production Warnings (MINOR)
**Warning**: `npm warn config production Use --omit=dev instead`

**Solution**: Already fixed in nixpacks.toml - will take effect on next deployment

### 3. Prisma Version Update (OPTIONAL)
**Notice**: Update available from 5.22.0 to 6.10.1

**Solution** (optional):
```bash
npm i --save-dev prisma@latest
npm i @prisma/client@latest
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Database Connection**:
   - Visit: `https://your-api-url.railway.app/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

2. **Test Authentication**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-api-url.railway.app/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "password": "Test123456!",
       "firstName": "Test",
       "lastName": "User",
       "organizationName": "Test Org"
     }'
   ```

3. **Check Logs**:
   - Monitor Railway logs for any errors
   - Look for successful database connections

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Database Migrations** (Priority 1)
   - Run baseline script to mark migrations as applied
   - Test creating a new user to verify schema

2. **Update Environment Variables** (Priority 2)
   - Ensure all production secrets are set
   - Verify CORS origins include your frontend URL

3. **Deploy Frontend** (Priority 3)
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Update API URL in frontend env vars

## Important Notes

- The API is running despite migration errors
- Database queries might fail if schema doesn't match
- Always backup data before running migration resets
- The health endpoint confirms basic connectivity

## Emergency Rollback

If issues persist:
1. Keep current deployment running
2. Create new database in Railway
3. Run fresh migrations on new database
4. Switch DATABASE_URL to new database
