- [ ] Create onboarding flow to improve user retention
- [ ] Plan feature roadmap for next development cycle
- [ ] Identify key metrics to track for measuring success

## Next Steps After 7 Days

After completing this 7-day plan, you should have a functional MVP that demonstrates the core value proposition of GlobFam. The next steps would include:

1. **User Testing**: Get feedback from a small group of target users
2. **Iteration**: Refine features based on user feedback
3. **Marketing**: Begin targeted outreach to Mongolian families studying in Australia
4. **Feature Expansion**: Develop additional features based on user needs
5. **Scaling**: Prepare infrastructure for handling more users as you grow

This plan provides a structured approach to building your application while focusing on the most critical features first. Adjustments may be needed based on progress and challenges encountered during development.
