# üì± GlobFam Mobile App Setup Guide

## Quick Overview
I've created a fully functional React Native mobile app with Expo. Here's how to get it running on your phone!

## üöÄ Baby Steps to Get the App on Your Phone

### Prerequisites
1. **Your Phone**: iPhone or Android
2. **Expo Go App**: Download from App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android)
3. **Your Computer**: Connected to the same WiFi as your phone

### Step 1: Install Expo Go on Your Phone
- **iPhone**: Search "Expo Go" in App Store and install
- **Android**: Search "Expo Go" in Google Play Store and install

### Step 2: Start the Development Server
Open Terminal on your Mac and run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the mobile app directory
cd /Users/khallydashdorj/Projects/globfam/globfam-mobile

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```

### Step 3: Connect Your Phone
After running `npx expo start`, you'll see:
1. A QR code in the terminal
2. Metro Bundler will open in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8081)

**To connect:**
- **iPhone**: Open Camera app, scan the QR code, tap the notification to open in Expo Go
- **Android**: Open Expo Go app, tap "Scan QR Code", scan the code

### Step 4: Wait for the App to Load
