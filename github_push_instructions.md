# Push to GitHub Instructions

Since this is your first push, you need to authenticate with GitHub. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Use GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "GlobFam"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Generate token and COPY IT (you won't see it again!)

Then run:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Khally01/GlobFam.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Use SSH (More secure long-term)

1. Generate SSH key if you don't have one:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

2. Add SSH key to GitHub:
- Copy your public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
- Paste the key

3. Change remote to SSH:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Khally01/GlobFam.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Use GitHub CLI (Easiest)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# Login
gh auth login

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

Choose the option that works best for you!
