## Quick Start Options

### For Testing the Concept:
- **No-code option**: Use Bubble.io or Webflow with Airtable
- **Low-code option**: Use Supabase + Next.js template
- **Full-code option**: MERN/MEAN stack or Django + React

### Estimated Costs:
- **Development**: $0 (DIY) - $50k+ (agency)
- **Hosting**: $20-500/month depending on scale
- **APIs**: $100-1000/month for financial data
- **Compliance**: $5k-20k for proper setup

The current GitHub Pages site is perfect for:
- Showing the concept to family/investors
- Getting user feedback on design
- Testing the pitch with potential customers
- Building an email list of interested users

To make it "real," focus on building a simple login + dashboard with mock data first!
