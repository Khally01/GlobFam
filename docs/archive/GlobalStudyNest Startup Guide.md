## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js and npm**: Install the latest LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Code Editor**: We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. **Git**: Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Extract the source code** from the provided ZIP file
2. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the extracted directory
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install pnpm if you don't have it
   npm install -g pnpm
   
   # Install project dependencies
   pnpm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
5. **Access the application** at `http://localhost:5173`

## Customization Guide

### Branding Customization

1. **Update application name and logo**:
   - Edit `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to change the logo and app name
   - Update `src/translations.ts` to modify the app name in both English and Mongolian

2. **Customize color scheme**:
   - The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Edit the theme colors in `tailwind.config.js` to match your brand
   - Primary color is currently emerald (`emerald-600`), which you can change to your brand color

3. **Update favicon and metadata**:
   - Replace `public/favicon.ico` with your own icon
   - Edit `index.html` to update metadata, title, and description

### Feature Customization

1. **Modify existing features**:
   - All components are in the `src/components` directory
   - Each feature has its own folder (dashboard, family, currency, academic, visa, regulatory)
   - Edit these files to adjust functionality, layout, and content

2. **Add new features**:
   - Create new component files in the appropriate directories
   - Update `src/App.tsx` to include your new components
   - Add new navigation items in `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

3. **Extend language support**:
   - All translations are in `src/translations.ts`
   - Add new keys for any new features
   - Consider adding additional languages beyond English and Mongolian
