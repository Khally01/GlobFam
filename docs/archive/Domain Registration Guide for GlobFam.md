# Domain Registration Guide for GlobFam

This guide provides instructions for checking the availability of your preferred domain names and registering them for your GlobFam startup.

## Recommended Domain Names

Based on your business requirements, we recommend securing the following domains:

1. **globfam.com.au** - Primary domain for Australian market
2. **globfam.io** - Secondary domain for international/tech presence

## How to Check Domain Availability

Due to anti-bot measures on domain registrars, you'll need to check availability manually:

### For .com and .io domains:

1. **GoDaddy**
   - Visit [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com/domains)
   - Enter "globfam.com" or "globfam.io" in the search box
   - View availability and pricing options

2. **Namecheap**
   - Visit [Namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com)
   - Search for "globfam.com" or "globfam.io"
   - Compare pricing with other registrars

### For .com.au domains:

1. **Australian Domain Registrars**
   - Visit [auDA-accredited registrars](https://www.auda.org.au/accredited-registrars)
   - Popular options include:
     - [Crazy Domains](https://www.crazydomains.com.au)
     - [VentraIP](https://ventraip.com.au)
     - [NetRegistry](https://www.netregistry.com.au)

2. **Eligibility Requirements**
   - For .com.au domains, you must have:
     - An Australian Business Number (ABN)
     - A business name that matches or is closely related to the domain name

## Registration Strategy

1. **Secure Both Domains**
   - Register both globfam.com.au and globfam.io if available
   - This provides market coverage and brand protection

2. **Registration Length**
   - Register for at least 2-3 years initially
   - Many registrars offer discounts for multi-year registrations

3. **Additional Services to Consider**
   - Privacy protection (not available for .com.au domains)
   - Auto-renewal to prevent accidental expiration
   - Email forwarding services

## Next Steps After Registration

1. **Set Up DNS**
   - Point domains to your hosting provider
   - Configure MX records for email services

2. **Deploy Your Application**
   - Follow the deployment guide provided earlier
   - Update any hardcoded URLs in your application

3. **Set Up Business Email**
   - Create professional email addresses (e.g., info@globfam.com.au)
   - Consider Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 for business email

4. **Monitor Expiration**
   - Set calendar reminders for domain renewal
   - Consider enabling auto-renewal

## Alternative Domain Options

If your preferred domains are unavailable, consider these alternatives:
- globfam-app.com
- myglobfam.com
- globfam.net
- getglobfam.com
- globfam.co

Remember that securing your domain name is an important step in establishing your brand identity online. The sooner you register your preferred domains, the better!
