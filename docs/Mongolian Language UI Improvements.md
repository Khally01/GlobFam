# Mongolian Language UI Improvements

## Overview of Changes

I've made comprehensive improvements to the GlobalStudyNest application to better support Mongolian language display. The changes focus on resolving the UI issues you identified in the screenshots, as well as potential issues throughout the application.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Flexible Container Widths
- Replaced fixed-width containers with flexible layouts that adapt to longer Mongolian text
- Added proper text wrapping for all text elements to prevent overflow

### 2. Responsive Layout Enhancements
- Implemented `flex-wrap` for all elements that display in rows to ensure proper wrapping on smaller screens
- Added appropriate margin and padding to maintain visual separation when text wraps

### 3. Progress Bar Improvements
- Fixed alignment of progress bar status text (the "115% шаардлагатай хөрөнгө бэлэн байна" issue)
- Ensured consistent spacing between labels and values

### 4. Card Layout Fixes
- Resolved the truncation issue in the visa compliance cards
- Balanced card widths for consistent display across the interface
- Improved spacing between card elements for better readability

### 5. Mobile Optimization
- Enhanced responsive breakpoints to better handle Mongolian text on smaller screens
- Added additional flex-wrap properties to ensure mobile compatibility

### 6. Text Alignment Refinements
- Fixed right-aligned text that was causing display issues with longer Mongolian strings
- Improved alignment of status indicators and labels

## Technical Implementation

The improvements were implemented through several key techniques:

1. **Flexbox Wrapping**: Added `flex-wrap: wrap` to all flex containers to handle text overflow
2. **Margin Control**: Added `mr-2 mb-1` or similar spacing to flex items to ensure proper spacing when wrapped
3. **Flex-shrink Control**: Added `flex-shrink-0` to icons and fixed-width elements to prevent them from being compressed
4. **Responsive Grid**: Enhanced grid layouts to better respond to content size rather than fixed widths
5. **Overflow Handling**: Improved text overflow handling with proper wrapping and ellipsis where appropriate

## Testing

The application has been thoroughly tested with Mongolian language enabled, focusing on:
- Desktop view (large screens)
- Tablet view (medium screens)
- Mobile view (small screens)
- Different content lengths and types

All previously identified issues have been resolved, and the application now provides a consistent experience in both English and Mongolian languages.

## Next Steps

While the current improvements address the immediate UI issues, here are some recommendations for future enhancements:

1. **Font Optimization**: Consider using fonts that better support Mongolian character display
2. **Cultural Customization**: Further adapt the UI to Mongolian cultural preferences
3. **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests for UI layout in multiple languages
4. **User Testing**: Conduct user testing with native Mongolian speakers to identify any remaining issues
