# Simplest Deployment - Everything on Railway

## Option 1: Railway Only (No Vercel Needed!)

Railway can host your entire app - both API and Web frontend.

### Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/khally/Documents/GitHub/GlobFam/globfam-saas
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Go to railway.app**

3. **Create New Project** â†’ "Deploy from GitHub"

4. **Deploy the Full App**:
   - Select your repo
   - Railway will detect the monorepo
   - It will create services for:
     - API (apps/api)
     - Web (apps/web)
     - PostgreSQL
     - Redis

5. **Set Environment Variables** in Railway dashboard

6. **Done!** Railway gives you URLs like:
   - API: `globfam-api.railway.app`
   - Web: `globfam-web.railway.app`

### Cost: ~$20-40/month for everything

## Option 2: Single VPS with Docker

Deploy everything using your docker-compose.yml:

1. **Get a VPS** (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)
   - $20/month gets you a decent server

2. **SSH into server and run**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Khally01/GlobFam.git
   cd GlobFam/globfam-saas
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Point your domain** to the VPS IP

### Cost: ~$20/month for VPS

## Option 3: Local Server (Free!)

If you have a spare computer or Raspberry Pi:

1. **Install Docker**
2. **Run docker-compose**
3. **Use ngrok** or **Cloudflare Tunnel** for public access
4. **Free** but requires your computer to stay on

- **Automatic deploys** from GitHub
- **Built-in database** and Redis
- **No need to manage servers**
- **Free tier** to start
- **Simple pricing** (~$20-40/month)
